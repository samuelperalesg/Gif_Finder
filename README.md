# GiFinder

Welcome to **GiFinder**! My first project, GiFinder, is a fun and interactive web application where users can easily search and find their favorite GIFs using the Giphy API. The idea behind GiFinder was to create a user-friendly platform that brings joy and laughter through the endless world of GIFs. Whether you're looking for something specific or just browsing for fun, GiFinder is here to light up your day with a bit of animated magic!

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and making the app visually appealing.
- **JavaScript & jQuery**: For dynamic content manipulation and API requests.
- **Google Fonts**: To beautify the text and enhance user experience.
- **Giphy API**: The core of GiFinder, providing a vast library of GIFs.
